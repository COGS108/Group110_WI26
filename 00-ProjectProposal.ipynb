    "We predict that countries with higher inflation rates will exhibit higher per-capita Bitcoin on-chain transaction volumes. This is because countries with higher inflation are economically unstable, whereas bitcoin offers a more stable means to accumulate wealth and do business. Moreover, we predict a correlation between countries with a higher IHDI index will have higher per-capita Bitcoin on-chain transaction volumes. This is due to countries with a higher IHDI index having a population with enough income to overcome barriers of entry to crypto (i.e owning an internet-connected device, electricity, etc). "

We would like to have 5 years per North American country. The total observations would be 115. This data would be found on websites hosted by reputable organizations. The data would ideally be in a CSV, SQL, or JSON format as we have example code to parse through datasets of this type. The data will ideally be found for free on the internet.

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "    > Our research uses public data that potentially introduces collection bias from its publishers. Global Change Data Lab’s collection of inequality data for IHDI may be incomplete on the households level or misattribute the migrated population. On-chain transaction volume data from Chainalysis may be misattributed due to the use of Virtual Private Networks. The sample of 151 countries could also be unrepresentative of excluded countries with limited records of cryptocurrency usage.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "    > Since our project deals with country-level data, there is minimal concern on the exposure of personal information. This responsibility lies in the organizations (Chainalysis, World Bank Group, Global Change Data Lab) who collected the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "    > Our research uses public data sources that do not require data storage or protection on our side.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "    > Our analysis addresses Bitcoin adoption on a country level, which may obscure within-countries disparities. While our choice of IHDI accounts for national inequality, treating countries as homogenous units inevitably misrepresents marginalized or minority socioeconomic groups. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "    > We acknowledge the presence of potential confounding factors like capital controls, internet infrastructure and regulatory pressure that have not been taken into account and may affect the investigated variables. Countries not included in our sample might also systematically differ in economic stability. To mitigate these biases, we plan to frame this research as exploring correlation and avoid causal interpretations of findings. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "    > By presenting countries using inflation rates and IHDI, there is potential risk in projecting judgements of countries being less or more advanced, which may be associated with historic inequalities. We plan to avoid such projection by presenting the model in a descriptive manner and avoiding assessments of institutional capability.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "    > In response to potential disparities in results for countries differing in income or population, we plan to examine the model by testing on these subgroups and refrain from generalized, global narratives.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "    > We recognize that per-capita on-chain transaction volumes is a partial proxy for Bitcoin adoption, since it does not take into account off-chain transactions, which are technically challenging to collect data on but nevertheless imply cryptocurrency adoption. This may underrepresent countries with currency instability, stricter cryptocurrency regulations, or mature fast-payment ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "    > This model could be potentially abused for policymaking purposes, constructing normative political narratives, or generalizing results to smaller regions. To prevent these abuses, we plan to clarify our scope, correlation-centered approach, and guidelines for proper use when presenting the model."
